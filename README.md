## Illumination Project

### Project Description:

The **Illumination Project** is a visually captivating webpage that uses cursor movement to reveal and highlight text. Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project creates a unique user experience by simulating a "spotlight" effect that illuminates the text as the user moves their cursor over it.

### Key Features:

1. **Interactive Design:**
   - The webpage features a dark background with hidden text, creating a mysterious and engaging atmosphere.
   - As users move their cursor, a circular area around the cursor lights up, revealing the underlying text in real-time.

2. **Dynamic Illumination:**
   - The spotlight effect is achieved using CSS properties and JavaScript, creating a smooth transition that follows the cursor's movement.
   - The intensity and radius of the illumination can be adjusted to enhance the visual impact.

3. **User Engagement:**
   - This project encourages user interaction by making the text discovery process interactive and enjoyable.
   - The use of the cursor as a tool to explore content adds an element of gamification, making it suitable for creative storytelling or artistic presentations.

4. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Utilizes CSS for styling the text and controlling the background and illumination effects.
   - JavaScript is employed to track cursor movements and dynamically update the illuminated area, ensuring a responsive and fluid experience.

5. **Versatility:**
   - The design can be adapted for various applications, such as interactive art, educational tools, or engaging web interfaces.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML5:** Structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS3:** Styling, including the dark background and illumination effects.
- **JavaScript:** Logic for cursor tracking and dynamic content display.

### Outcome:

The Illumination Project demonstrates an innovative use of web technologies to create an interactive and visually compelling user experience. This project highlights my skills in front-end development, particularly in creating dynamic and engaging web applications that go beyond traditional static designs.
